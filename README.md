# Yummy Trail

This app will be used to make a trail of the places where you like to eat out and make future reccomendations based on mood, time, etc. It will kind of be like a food diary for people who eat out on a regular basis. I will use the yelp api and google maps. I will use AngularJS to model my data and twitter bootstrap for some straightforward styling.
